/**
 * Exercise 4B - All together!
 *
 * Copy over the `TodoList` component you wrote from
 * Exercise 4a into this file.
 *
 * In this exercise, we will enhance our `TodoList`
 * to toggle the completed value of a todo item.
 *
 * When a todo item's checkbox is clicked, find
 * the item in the list and toggle it's value.
 *
 *`console.log` the value to check that it works
 * as expected.
 *
 * NOTE: to "toggle" a value means to flip it;
 * ie, if the value is false it becomes true.
 *
 * HINT: Accept an `onChecked` function via props.
