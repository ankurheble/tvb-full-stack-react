/**
 * Exercise 2 - props.children
 * 
 * `props.children` is a special property that is available
 * on all React components. React injects this property on 
 * the `props` object whenever a component has nested children.
 * 
 * Ex:
 * In this example, "Click me" will be avaiable in 
 * the react component as `props.children`. 
 *```js
    <Button>
      Click Me
    </Button>
  ```
 * 
 * The children of a component may be a string (as in the case above),
 * HTML or any other React component
 * 
 * Create a function component called `Button` that displays
 * custom text instead of just the string "Click Me" as in our
 * previous example.
 * */

import React from "react";


// export default Button;
